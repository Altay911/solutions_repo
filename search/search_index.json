Simulations provide an intuitive and hands-on way to observe this phenomenon in action. Task Overview 1. Simulating Sampling Distributions: Select several types of population distributions, such as: - Uniform distribution - Exponential distribution - Binomial distribution For each distribution, generate a large dataset representing the population. 2. Sampling and Visualization: Randomly sample data from the population and calculate the sample mean for different sample sizes (e.g., 5, 10, 30, 50). Repeat the process multiple times to create a sampling distribution of the sample mean. Plot histograms of the sample means for each sample size and observe the convergence to a normal distribution. 3. Parameter Exploration: Investigate how the shape of the original distribution and the sample size influence the rate of convergence to normality. Highlight the impact of the population\u2019s variance on the spread of the sampling distribution. 4. Practical Applications: Reflect on the importance of the CLT in real-world scenarios, such as: - Estimating population parameters. - Quality control in manufacturing. - Predicting outcomes in financial models. Deliverables: A Markdown document and Python scripts or notebooks implementing the simulations for various population distributions. Plots illustrating the sampling distributions and their progression toward normality. A discussion on the implications of the results and their connection to theoretical expectations. Hints and Resources: Use Python libraries such as NumPy for random number generation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

One of the most elegant applications of Monte Carlo methods is estimating the value of Pi through geometric probability.

Task Overview Part 1: Estimating Pi Using a Circle 1. Theoretical Foundation: Explain how the ratio of points inside a circle to the total number of points in a square can be used to estimate Pi. Derive the formula for Pi based on a unit circle. 2. Simulation: Generate random points in a 2D square bounding a unit circle. Count the number of points falling inside the circle. Estimate Pi based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points. 3.
